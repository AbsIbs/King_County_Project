## Overview
This aim of this project is to utilize **regression algorithms** to predict final house sale prices in King County in Washington State. The project is from the perspective of being hypothetically commissioned by a local realty company in Seattle to produce a model to accurately predict sale prices. 
<br><br>
For the project, both a **predictive model** and **inferential model** have been created.
<br><br>
The regression algorithms used are:
>Linear Regression<br>
>Random Forest<br>
>Gradient Boosting<br>
>Histogram Gradient Boosting<br>

## Requirements
This project assumes you already have these system dependencies set up:
- **Python 3.8.5**
- **pip**
- **Conda environment set-up**

## Installation
As all the dependencies are stored in the **requirements.txt** file, running this command in your bash/terminal  <br>
```bash
pip: -r requirements.txt
```

## Demo and Usage
The project has been summarized in the form of a **house prediction** <a href="https://kc-house-predictor.herokuapp.com/">webapp</a> where users can select values from a host of features and retrieve the predicted house price.
